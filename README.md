# SGX Vector Upload Backend

This Java application generates two random integer vectors and uploads them to an **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)** via SSH. These vectors are then used by a **secure SGX enclave** to perform vector addition inside a **trusted execution environment (TEE)** using Intel SGX.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Generates vectors of configurable size (default: `100`)
- Uploads vectors to Azure VM using SSH and `echo`
- Formats vectors as **space-separated integers** for SGX compatibility
- Works with a C++ SGX app that securely performs vector addition

## üõ† Configuration

Update the following constants in `Main.java` as per your environment:

```java
private static final String SSH_KEY_PATH = System.getProperty("user.home") + "\\Downloads\\sgx-7_key.pem";
private static final String VM_IP = "20.115.92.71"; // Replace with your Azure VM IP
private static final String VM_USERNAME = "ankit";  // Replace with your VM username
üöÄ How to Run
You can run this via Eclipse IDE or any Java IDE.

Open the project in Eclipse.

Right-click Main.java > Run As > Java Application.

Console output will confirm vector generation and upload:
```

## üì¶ Generating vectors and sending to Azure VM...
```
‚úÖ Vector files uploaded to VM:
   ‚Ä¢ /home/ankit/data/vector1.txt
   ‚Ä¢ /home/ankit/data/vector2.txt
   ```
# üß† What Happens Next in Azure VM?

Once the vectors are saved to disk on the VM:

A C++ SGX application reads /home/ankit/data/vector1.txt and vector2.txt.

The application loads the vectors into memory.
It passes them securely to an SGX enclave.

Inside the enclave, secure vector addition is performed.

Results are fetched back and printed from the untrusted host app.

To trigger the computation manually, run:

```
cd ~/linux-sgx/SampleCode/SampleEnclave
make
./app
```
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue

Only the first ~25 elements of the vector are correctly added.

Beyond that, results may contain garbage or zero values, e.g.:

```
Result[24] = 10
Result[25] = 1196315971
Result[26] = -150858992
...
Result[99] = 0
```

## üõ† Work In Progress

Likely due to:

Buffer size mismatch

Incorrect memory allocation

Alignment or pointer errors in ecall_vector_add

Debugging is ongoing.
